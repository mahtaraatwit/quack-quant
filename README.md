I have been studying C++ in depth, using the following resources:

C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives Pricing

C++ Concurrency in Action

C++ Move Semantics

C++ High Performance

Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This emphasis on C++ is due to the fact that many companies in the field of low latency trading tend to ask difficult C++ questions in their interview process.

In addition to C++, I have also been studying finance, specifically:

Energy Trading and Risk Management

Successful Algorithmic Trading

Lastly, I have been learning about socket programming and networks, using these resources:

Beej's Guide to Network Programming

Designing Data-Intensive Applications

To supplement my learning, I have also been using Leetcode to practice and improve my coding skills.

I also pirated all these book except beej’s guid, so please don’t tell anyone

OS, networking, concurrency, and system design.

Resources I went through for those interested:

NeetCode.io (150 LC questions)

"Cracking the Coding Interview" (book)

"System Design Interview" (book)

"Developing high-frequency trading systems" (book, lower value, more out of interest)

Grokking the system design interview, grokking the networking interview - Educative (free 1 week trial, finished both in that time)

Bits and bytes of networking by Google, 'OS, concurrency, virtualisation' - Coursera (free 1 week trial, finished in that time)

Start prepping your numerical skills and practice brainteasers as soon as possible. Check https://www.tradermath.org/ for both of these.

To get a feel for the business, read stuff like:

Black Swan - Taleb, Antifragile - Taleb, The Complete Guide to Capital Markets for Quantitative Professionals, Financial Engineering: The Evolution of a Profession, My Life as a Quant: Reflections on Physics and Finance, The Quants: How a New Breed of Math Whizzes Conquered Wall Street and Nearly Destroyed It, How I Became a Quant: Insights from 25 of Wall Street's Elite, What do quants do ?
