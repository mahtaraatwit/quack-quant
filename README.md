I have been studying C++ in depth, using the following resources:

C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives Pricing

C++ Concurrency in Action

C++ Move Semantics

C++ High Performance

Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This emphasis on C++ is due to the fact that many companies in the field of low latency trading tend to ask difficult C++ questions in their interview process.

In addition to C++, I have also been studying finance, specifically:

Energy Trading and Risk Management

Successful Algorithmic Trading

Lastly, I have been learning about socket programming and networks, using these resources:

Beej's Guide to Network Programming

Designing Data-Intensive Applications

To supplement my learning, I have also been using Leetcode to practice and improve my coding skills.

I also pirated all these book except beej’s guid, so please don’t tell anyone
